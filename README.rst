pyScaf
======

pyScaf orders contigs from genome assemblies utilising several types of information:

- paired-end (PE) and/or mate-pair libraries (`NGS-based mode <#NGS-based scaffolding>`_)
- long reads (`Scaffolding based on long reads <#Scaffolding based on long reads>`_)
- synteny to the genome of some related species (`Reference-based scaffolding <#Reference-based-scaffolding>`_)

=================
Scaffolding modes
=================

NGS-based scaffolding
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This is under development... Stay tuned. 

Scaffolding based on long reads
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In this mode, pyScaf aligns long reads onto the contigs, identifies the reads the connects two or more contigs and join adjacent contigs.  

Long reads are aligned locally onto contigs, ignoring:

- matches not satisfying cut-offs (``--identity`` and ``--overlap``)
- suboptimal matches (only best match of each query to reference is kept) 
- and removing overlapping matches on reference. 

**Note, this is experimental implementation.** 

Reference-based scaffolding
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In reference-based mode, pyScaf uses synteny to the genome of closely related species in order to order contigs and estimate distances between adjacent contigs.

Contigs are aligned locally onto reference chromosomes, ignoring:

- matches not satisfying cut-offs (``--identity`` and ``--overlap``)
- suboptimal matches (only best match of each query to reference is kept) 
- and removing overlapping matches on reference. 

In preliminary tests, pyScaf performed superbly on simulated heterozygous genomes based on *C. parapsilosis* (13 Mb; CANPA) and *A. thaliana* (119 Mb; ARATH) chromosomes, reconstructing correctly all chromosomes always for CANPA and nearly always for ARATH (`Figures in dropbox <https://www.dropbox.com/sh/bb7lwggo40xrwtc/AAAZ7pByVQQQ-WhUXZVeJaZVa/pyScaf?dl=0>`_, `CANPA table <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1InBExy-qKDLj-upd8tlPItVSKc4mLepZjZxB31ii9OY/edit#gid=2036953672>`_, `ARATH table <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1InBExy-qKDLj-upd8tlPItVSKc4mLepZjZxB31ii9OY/edit#gid=1920757821>`_).  
Runs took ~0.5 min for CANPA on ``4 CPUs`` and ~2 min for ARATH on ``16 CPUs``. 

**Important remarks:**

- Reduce your assembly before (fasta2homozygous.py) as any redundancy will likely break the synteny.
- pyScaf works better with contigs than scaffolds, as scaffolds are often affected by mis-assemblies (no *de novo assembler* / scaffolder is perfect...), which breaks synteny. 
- pyScaf works very well if divergence between reference genome and assembled contigs is below 20% at nucleotide level. 
- pyScaf deals with large rearrangements ie. deletions, insertion, inversions, translocations. **Note however, this is experimental implementation!**
- Consider closing gaps after scaffolding.

Test run
~~~~~~~~
To perform reference-based assembly, provide assembled contigs and reference genome in FastA format.
Dotplots of below runs can be found in `docs </docs>`_.  
If you wish to skip dotplot generation (ie. no X11 on your system), provide ``--dotplot ''`` parameter.

.. code-block:: bash

    # scaffold homogenised assembly (reduced contigs)
    ./pyScaf.py -f test/contigs.reduced.fa -r test/ref.fa -o test/contigs.reduced.ref.fa

    # scaffold reduced contigs using global mode (no norearrangements allowed)
    ./pyScaf.py -f test/contigs.reduced.fa -r test/ref.fa -o test/contigs.reduced.ref.global.fa --norearrangements

    # scaffold heterozygous assembly (de novo assembled contigs)
    ./pyScaf.py -f test/contigs.fa -r test/ref.fa -o test/contigs.ref.fa

================
Proof of concept
================
pyScaf is under heavy development right now.
Nevertheless, both the reference-based mode and long-read mode are functional and produces meaningful assemblies.
pyScaf has been implemented in `Redundans <https://github.com/lpryszcz/redundans>`_.

For more info, have a look in `workbook <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WNw6FYZXNI2sKJ1hBZ0LI9CWJSQ-BTQID7jL9lLvYaA/edit?usp=sharing>`_.
